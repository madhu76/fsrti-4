                    The growing aspirations, technology growth, ability to visualise many dimensions and the conflicting situations and contexts leading to complex scenarios largely govern the present- day real world, thus rendering the study of these interdisciplinary problems
                    more stimulating and rewarding. The existing scientific/technological approaches are inadequate to provide semantic solutions to this type of real-world problem. This necessitates the development of synergies of knowledge-driven and
                    data-driven methodologies innovatively to support short- term and long-term, generalised and personalised, universal and context-specific objectives. Identifying, characterising, classifying such gaps, mapping existing technologies
                    and highlighting their limitations, and constructing counter demonstrative illustrations are intermediate challenges to the current researchers/solution providers. These things demand novel and inclusive platform(s). The motivation
                    for the present endeavour stems from the above observations.

                        Also, it has been seen in recent years that Information Technology is witnessing ups and downs, and for a while in the past, this had been on the rise, but a recent slump has affected its growth. This was understood to be due to a rather large gap between
                        the creative-end and the user-end, and this gap is on the rise. It is our endeavour to bridge this gap and redefine “Science and Technology” by promoting our new International quarterly peer-reviewed Journal on “Innovation Sciences
                        and Sustainable Technologies”. This journal is not only backed by academicians but also by many field specialists who could implement their ideas and check the results. It is not any more a mere guess but a reality that in the
                        near future, the existing practices will be replaced by more sophisticated processes given by the user community. This journal is intended to stimulate new ideas and foster practical applications from the research and developmental
                        findings.

                        <b>The Journal of Innovation Sciences and Sustainable Technologies will publish four
                          issues in the months of January, April, July and October of each year beginning the
